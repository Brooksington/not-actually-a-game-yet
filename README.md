should be able to fire the "game" up by launching index.html

There isnt much in the way of gameplay. I've spent most of my time messing with canvas, and learning how it works. 
The messing with canvas is what led me down the dark...DARK path of trying to track all movement with (x,y). Could I make using (x,y) work? Almost assuredly so,
but it feels inefficient and dangerous by comparison to just rendering everything based upon matrix position.
